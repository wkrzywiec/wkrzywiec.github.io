The AI revolution is here. The release of ChatGpt in November 2022 ignited a new revolution in software, where generative AI plays a central role. New tools and patterns emerged which enables us, software engineers, to build new, exciting projects. It's so hard to keep up with it because almost every week a new thing comes up. 

At least for me it is sometimes hard to keep up with all new things. Hence to fight off my fear-of-missing-out and to extend my professional toolbox I have created this series in which I will describe how to build an application that is powered by the AI. But before that keep in mind I am not an AI engineer and I have only a basic knowledge on machine learning. I am not an expert in this field but I hope that with this series it will become a little bit more clear to me and perhpaps you, the reader, will also learn something too. 

(And I hope that this series won't share the fate of previous series that I abondend after one or two entries üòúü§û)

## The Project - üë®‚Äçüç≥ Nutri Chef AI

I like to learn based on close to real-life projects. Hence I've decided to built a nutrition assistance application, which will help me plan all my meals for the entire week. I want to keep my meals healthy balanced with all needed macronutrients on a good level.

Because I already has a large number of favourite recipies I don't want to really on something that is on the Internet. I want my AI nutrition assistant to plan my meals based on my prompt and cookbook.

```
OBRAZEK ≈ºe ja odpytujƒô AIa, a on sprawdza mi w ksiƒÖzce kucharskiej i daje listƒô
```

This requirement brings us to a first problem - how to provide my entire cookbook to the AI? 

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)


### pattern

### what are vectors?

### Storing vectors

## Vectorize db data

### Chunking data

## Utilizing vectors in application

### Search best fitting recipes

### Enriching prompt with knowledge base data

## Going deeper
